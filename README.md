# MPA_targets
This repository was created to accompany the paper "Diversifying Global Biodiversity MPA Targets" specifically addressing Aichi Target 11 and Target 3 of the Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF).

This paper explores the diversity of MPA (Marine Protected Area) target implementations and predicts their catch benefits given different MPA designs and fishing pressure reductions.
